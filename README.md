This is a place for me to play with different ideas around React, Flux, Redux, and whatever else floats my boat at the time.   


### the experiments
cycle+xstream(UI), synaptic(Neural Net), and cytoscape(visualize graph) - [[demo]](https://crosshj.com/sandbox/src/cycle-synaptic/colors)  [[source]](https://github.com/crosshj/sandbox/tree/master/src/cycle-synaptic)

React and Redux in one page with no JSX, no Babel, no Webpack - [[demo]](https://crosshj.com/sandbox/src/minimal/react-redux-skeleton/redux-react-index)  [[source]](https://github.com/crosshj/sandbox/tree/master/src/minimal/react-redux-skeleton)

### TODO

use github api - https://api.github.com/repos/crosshj/sandbox/contents/src
get list of projects and append to repo "splash" page
(this way splash page is a dynamic page of various projects)
