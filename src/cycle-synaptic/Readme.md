## About

This started life as a copy of Heather Arthur's Brain.JS demo.  The idea is to train a simple neural net in the browser.  There are 3 inputs corresponding to red, green, and blue values (integers from 0 to 255 normalized to a float between 0 and 1) and there is one output corresponding to white and black.
