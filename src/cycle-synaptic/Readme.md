## About

This started life as a copy of Heather Arthur's Brain.JS [demo](https://harthur.github.io/brain/).  The idea is to illustrate neural networks by training a simple neural net in the browser.

- There are 3 inputs: red, green, and blue (integers from 0 to 255 normalized to a float between 0 and 1).
- There is one output: white(0) and black(1).
